- The owner of a root domain can create any number of subdomains off the root domain. Each subdomain may resolve to a different IP address. So the owner of cs260.click can have subdomains for travel (travel.cs260.click), finance (finance.cs260.click), or a blog (blog.cs260.click).
- The DNS database records that facilitate the mapping of domain names to IP addresses come in several flavors. The main ones we are concerned with are the address (A) and the canonical name (CNAME) records. An A record is a straight mapping from a domain name to IP address. A CNAME record maps one domain name to another domain name. This acts as a domain name alias. You would use a CNAME to do things like map byu.com to the same IP address as byu.edu so that either one could be used.
